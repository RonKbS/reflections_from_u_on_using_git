Checking out what happens when repo online is different from local

--When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

In my case, it's not safe so any time I lose my pc, at least I have an online backup

--Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
 automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Pulling changes leaves you with control incase any unwanted
changes have been made

--Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
use one instead of another?
Forks operate in github and have same functionality as clones, clones work 
btn locall and github, creating repos on local, branches are tracks taken 
for differnet commits from one parent commit
