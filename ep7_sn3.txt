Checking out what happens when repo online is different from local

--When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

In my case, it's not safe so any time I lose my pc, at least I have an online backup

--Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
 automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Pulling changes leaves you with control incase any unwanted
changes have been made

--Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
use one instead of another?
Forks operate in github and have same functionality as clones, clones work 
btn locall and github, creating repos on local, branches are tracks taken 
for differnet commits from one parent commit

--What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it 
in
the diagram the way we do?
Merging two branches introduces a new commit at that point. The representation
is so because a combination is bing introduced

--What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
Hadn't considered that we were performing automatic branches...but I guess you
have more control when you're doing it manually as opposed to automatically. 
On the other hand, that would take time

--What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote 
stored locally?
With this copy I'm able to make merges incase I update my local or an update
is available in the hub
